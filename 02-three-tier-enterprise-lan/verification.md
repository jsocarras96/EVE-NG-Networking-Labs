# Verification

This file documents the commands and tests used to verify the Three-Tier Enterprise LAN Lab.

## 1. VLAN and Trunk Verification

Commands used:

```cisco
show vlan brief
show interfaces trunk
```

Expected result:

* VLANs 10, 20, 30, 99, 100, and 999 should exist.
* Trunk links should allow VLANs 10, 20, 30, 99, 100, and 999.
* Native VLAN should be VLAN 99.

Example devices to verify:

```cisco
CSW-DC-01
ASW-DC-01
ASW-DC-02
CSW-A-01
ASW-A-01
CSW-B-01
ASW-B-01
```

Status: Passed / Pending

## 2. STP Verification

Commands used:

```cisco
show spanning-tree summary
show spanning-tree vlan 10
show spanning-tree vlan 20
show spanning-tree vlan 99
```

Expected result:

* Rapid-PVST should be enabled.
* Root bridge placement should match the lab design.
* Access ports should use PortFast and BPDU Guard where appropriate.

Status: Passed / Pending

## 3. Layer 3 Interface Verification

Commands used:

```cisco
show ip interface brief
show ip route connected
```

Expected result:

* Routed interfaces should be up/up.
* SVIs should be up/up for active VLANs.
* Connected routes should appear for local VLANs and point-to-point links.

Status: Passed / Pending

## 4. OSPF Verification

Commands used:

```cisco
show ip ospf neighbor
show ip ospf interface brief
show ip route ospf
show ip protocols
```

Expected result:

* OSPF neighbors should form between Layer 3 devices.
* Remote site networks should appear in the routing table as OSPF routes.
* User/server VLANs should be advertised into OSPF.
* End-user VLAN interfaces should be passive when appropriate.

Status: Passed / Pending

## 5. Inter-Site Connectivity Tests

Test from Data Center to Site-A:

```bash
ping 10.1.99.10
```

Test from Data Center to Site-B:

```bash
ping 10.2.99.10
```

Test from Site-A to Site-B:

```bash
ping 10.2.99.10
```

Test from Site-B to Site-A:

```bash
ping 10.1.99.10
```

Expected result:

* Devices in different sites should be able to reach each other according to the routing design.

Status: Passed / Pending

## 6. Default Route Verification

Commands used:

```cisco
show ip route 0.0.0.0
show ip route
```

Expected result:

* Core switches should have a default route pointing toward the upstream router.
* Remote sites should have a valid path back to the Data Center and other site networks.

Status: Passed / Pending

## 7. Isolated VLAN Verification

Commands used:

```cisco
show access-lists
show running-config interface vlan 999
```

Connectivity tests from an isolated VLAN host:

```bash
ping <default-gateway>
ping <internal-site-network>
ping <allowed-external-destination>
```

Expected result:

* VLAN 999 should be restricted by ACL.
* The isolated VLAN should not have unrestricted access to internal private networks.
* Allowed traffic should work according to the ACL design.

Status: Passed / Pending

## 8. SSH Management Verification

Commands used:

```cisco
show ip ssh
show running-config | section line vty
```

SSH test:

```bash
ssh admin@<device-management-ip>
```

Expected result:

* SSH version 2 should be enabled.
* VTY lines should use local login.
* Remote access should be limited to SSH.

Status: Passed / Pending

## 9. Port Security / Access Port Verification

Commands used:

```cisco
show port-security
show port-security interface gigabitEthernet0/1
show interfaces status
```

Expected result:

* Access ports should be assigned to the correct VLAN.
* PortFast and BPDU Guard should be enabled on end-device ports.
* Port security should match the lab requirements if configured.

Status: Passed / Pending

## 10. Final Result

The lab successfully verifies:

* VLAN segmentation
* 802.1Q trunking
* Native VLAN 99
* Rapid-PVST
* Layer 3 routed links
* Inter-VLAN routing
* OSPF routing between sites
* Default routing
* Isolated VLAN filtering
* SSH-based management access
* Basic enterprise LAN troubleshooting

Final status: Passed / Pending
