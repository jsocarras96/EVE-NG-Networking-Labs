# ASA Destination NAT Lab for Movable Server-A

##Objective

This lab was created to demonstrate how a Cisco ASA can be configured to allow an external client to reach an internal server using a fixed destination IP address, even when the real server is moved between different sites.

The main requirement is that any client behind R-Client should be able to reach 8.8.8.8 using ICMP, SSH, or HTTPS. The ASA translates that destination IP to the current real IP address of Server-A, depending on where the server is located.

Business Scenario

A network engineer requested a lab example showing how the ASA configuration would work before applying a similar design in a real environment.

##The company has two internal sites:

- Site-A: 192.168.1.0/24
- Site-B: 10.100.100.0/24

##Server-A can be located in either site:

- Server-A in Site-A: 192.168.1.10
- Server-A in Site-B: 10.100.100.10

External clients should not need to know the real IP address of Server-A. They should always connect to the same destination IP: 8.8.8.8.

##Lab Goals

- Site-A and Site-B must be able to communicate with each other.
- Both sites must have connectivity to the external server network 4.4.4.0/29.
- Clients behind R-Client must be able to reach 8.8.8.8 using ICMP, SSH, or HTTPS.
- The ASA must translate traffic destined to 8.8.8.8 into Server-A's current real IP address.
- If Server-A is moved from one site to the other, only the ASA SERVER_A object needs to be updated.
